Albert Camus ♦ THE STRANGER 



About the Author 



ALBERT CAMUS was born in Mondovi, Algeria, in 1913. After winning a degree 
in philosophy, he worked at various jobs, ending up in journalism. In the thirties he 
ran a theatrical company, and during the war was active in the French Resistance, 
editing an important underground paper, Combat. Among his major works are four 
widely praised works of fiction, The Stranger (1946), The Plague (1948), The Fall 
(1957), and Exile and the Kingdom (1958); a volume of plays, Caligula and Three 
Other Plays (1958); and two books of philosophical essays, The Rebel (1954) and 
The Myth of Sisyphus (1955), both of which are available in the Vintage series. 
Albert Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. He was killed in 
an automobile accident on January 4, 1960. 

THIS BOOK was set on the Linotype in Janson, an excellent example o f the 
influential and sturdy Dutch types that prevailed in England prior to the development 
by William Caslon of his own designs, which he evolved from these Dutch faces. Of 
Janson himself little is known except that he was a practicing type-founder in Leipzig 
during the years 1660 to 1687. Printed and bound by THE COLONIAL PRESS 
INC., Clinton, Massachusetts. Cover design by LEO LIONNI.
