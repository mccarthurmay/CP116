#pieces of Machine Learning

#dataset
#   -data we want to analyze
#   -supervised machine learning problem
#       -dataset looks like pairs, xy, of input and target output
#   -unsupervices machine Learning
#       -only has x, want to discover something about the data

#model
#   -piece of our code that can actually learn
#   -Linear regression
#   -CNNs
#   -transformer (chatgpt)

#evaluation
#   -how to tell if the model is doing well
#       -Error
#       -accuracy
#       -likelihood
#   -"loss function"

#training



#linear regression model: We have a bunch of points and we want to find the line of best fit
